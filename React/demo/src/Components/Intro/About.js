      <p>
        Most apps need to know the identity of a user. Knowing a user's identity
        allows an app to securely save user data in the cloud and provide the
        same personalized experience across all of the user's devices. Firebase
        Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and
        ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. It supports
        authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated
        identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more. Firebase
        Authentication integrates tightly with other Firebase services, and it
        leverages industry standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, so it
        can be easily integrated with your custom backend.
